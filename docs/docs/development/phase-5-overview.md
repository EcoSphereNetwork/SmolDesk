# Phase 5 Overview

This phase focuses on validating individual UI components in Storybook.

## Goals
- Provide a Storybook story for every component
- Capture visual snapshots using Playwright component tests
- Run accessibility checks with `jest-axe`

Snapshots will serve as a reference for future UI changes. Storybook will also document props and usage examples.

## Progress
Phase 5.1 started with Storybook setup and initial tests for the Button component.
