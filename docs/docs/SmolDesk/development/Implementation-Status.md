# SmolDesk Development Plan

## Project Overview

SmolDesk is a WebRTC-based remote desktop application for Linux, designed to provide low-latency screen sharing and remote control capabilities. The application supports both X11 and Wayland display servers and utilizes hardware acceleration for optimal performance.

## Current Implementation Status

We have established the foundational architecture for SmolDesk with the following components:

### Backend (Rust/Tauri)
- Basic screen capture functionality for X11 and Wayland
- Input forwarding mechanism for keyboard and mouse events
- System detection for display servers and monitor configuration
- Integration with Tauri for frontend communication

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)
- Connection management using WebRTC
- Remote screen display with scaling and fullscreen capabilities
- Input event handling and forwarding
- User interface for configuration and status monitoring

### Core Features
- WebRTC signaling server for peer discovery and connection establishment
- P2P connection with STUN/TURN server fallback
- Video encoding with multiple codec support (H264, VP8, VP9, AV1)
- Hardware acceleration options (VAAPI, NVENC, QuickSync)
