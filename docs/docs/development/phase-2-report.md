# Phase 2 Report

This document summarizes the completion status of the prioritized UI components during Phase 2.

## Validated Components

- **ClipboardSync** – code, tests and documentation verified
- **ConnectionManager** – basic connection handling completed
- **FileTransfer** – simple data channel helpers implemented
- **RemoteScreen** – displays MediaStream with input toggling

See [status overview](../components/status.md) for detailed commit references.

## Test Coverage

- Unit tests run with `vitest`
- Accessibility checks via `jest-axe` are in place where DOM output exists
- Demo components under `src/components/*.demo.tsx` showcase default usage

## Limitations

- Some tests rely on JSDOM and are skipped due to missing `RTCPeerConnection`
- Event handling for advanced WebRTC scenarios is not fully implemented

## Architecture Notes

- React components interact with the Tauri backend using context providers
- IPC channels remain thin wrappers; further e2e tests are needed

## Recommendations for Phase 3

- Integrate tests into GitHub Actions using a matrix build
- Expand coverage for WebRTC error handling
- Add end-to-end tests with Playwright or similar tools
