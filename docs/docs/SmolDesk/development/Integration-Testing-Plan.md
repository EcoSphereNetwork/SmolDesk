## Test Execution Plan

### Testing Phases
1. **Component Testing**: Verify individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Testing**: Test component interactions
3. **System Testing**: End-to-end testing of the complete system
4. **Performance Testing**: Measure performance under various conditions
5. **Security Testing**: Verify security features and look for vulnerabilities

### Test Matrix
Each test should be performed on the following combinations:
- X11 host to Chrome client
- X11 host to Firefox client
- Wayland host to Chrome client
- Wayland host to Firefox client

For each display server and browser combination, tests should be run with:
- Software encoding
- Hardware encoding (when available)
- Various network conditions

### Test Reporting
For each test, record:
- Test case ID and description
- Environment details (OS, browser, network conditions)
- Steps executed
- Actual results
- Pass/Fail status
- Performance metrics (where applicable)
- Screenshots or video captures (where appropriate)
- Any bugs or issues found

## Continuous Integration Plan

### Automated Tests
The following tests should be automated as part of the CI pipeline:
- WebRTC connection establishment
- Basic screen capture functioning
- Security verification tests
- API validation tests

### Manual Tests
The following tests require manual verification:
- Visual quality assessment
- Latency perception
- Complex interaction scenarios
- Cross-device compatibility

## Security Testing

### Methodology
1. **Static Analysis**: Use tools to scan for vulnerabilities in code
2. **Penetration Testing**: Attempt to exploit security weaknesses
3. **Fuzz Testing**: Input random/unexpected data to find bugs
4. **Authentication Testing**: Verify auth flows cannot be bypassed
5. **Network Analysis**: Verify encryption of data in transit

### Security Test Cases
- Authentication bypass attempts
- Man-in-the-middle attack simulation
- Token tampering attempts
- Denial of service resistance
- Input validation tests

## Conclusion

This testing plan provides a comprehensive approach to verifying the integration and optimization work done on SmolDesk. By thoroughly executing these tests, we can ensure that:

1. The modular screen capture integrates seamlessly with WebRTC
2. Security measures are properly implemented and effective
3. Performance meets or exceeds target metrics
4. The system is robust against various edge cases and network conditions

Test results should be documented and any issues found should be prioritized for fixing before proceeding to Phase 2 of the project.
