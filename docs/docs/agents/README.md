# Agent Based Development

SmolDesk uses automated agents like **Codex** to maintain the project. Agents perform analysis, run tests and create pull requests.

## Available Agents
- **Codex** – general repository automation and refactoring.
- **OpenHands** – documentation parser and linter.

Agents follow the workflow described in `AGENTS.md`.
