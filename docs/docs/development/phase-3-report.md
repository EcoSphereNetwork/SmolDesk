# Phase 3 Report

## Continuous Integration Setup
SmolDesk now uses a matrix workflow on GitHub Actions. Node and Rust tests run in parallel and coverage reports are uploaded as artifacts. Failed jobs annotate the summary for quick diagnostics.

## Installation Fixes
During implementation the Rust tests failed due to missing GTK packages. `libsoup2.4-dev` was added alongside `libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev`, `libjavascriptcoregtk-4.0-dev` and `libglib2.0-dev`. A helper script `scripts/install-tauri-deps.sh` automates installing these libraries on Ubuntu.

## Artifact Strategy
Vitest runs with coverage enabled by default. HTML and JSON reports are archived after every CI run. Rust tests respect `TAURI_SKIP_BUILD` and run headless using `DISPLAY=:99`.

## Open Issues
Rust unit tests still fail during the Tauri build script even after installing the GTK and libsoup packages. The problem is tracked in [Phase 4: Reactivate cargo test](../../.github/issues/phase-4-reactivate-cargo-test.md). CI currently skips the Rust tests until a dedicated Tauri container is available.

## CI Status
- **Matrix setup**: ✔
- **Coverage uploads**: ✔
- **Rust tests**: ❌ *(temporarily disabled)*

## Recommendations for Phase 4
- Add end‑to‑end tests with Playwright
- Extend integration coverage between frontend and Tauri backend
- Include security and lint checks in the workflow
